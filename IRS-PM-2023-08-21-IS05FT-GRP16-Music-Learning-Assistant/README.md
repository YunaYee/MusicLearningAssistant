## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
A large audience interested in music education, although the high tuition fees and popularity of piano and guitar lessons pose challenges. The project addresses issues such as evaluation consistency, cost, and noise reduction to enhance the music learning experience. The system's architecture combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for music analysis, OpenL3 for audio feature extraction, OpenAI for personalized suggestions and Item-KNN for music recommendations. Data preparation involves acquiring and preprocessing training and test datasets, while piano detection and similarity calculations are performed using CNN and OpenL3. The recommendation system utilizes text similarity and Item-KNN to provide personalized piano music suggestions.
